                <h3>Welcome</h3>
                <p>    
                    Welcome to The Lox Bagel and Coffee Shop where we have been serving up bagels and coffee since the time of Moshe (okay,
                    not <i>that</i> long, but long enough).  We invite you to come in and enjoy our fresh made bagels, in a variety of styles, with
                    a variety of speads and topping (lox, honey flavored cream cheese, and more).  While you are at it, have a cup of our
                    fresh-brewed coffee (regular ,or decaf if you like).
                </p>
                
                <h3>Something New</h3>
                <p>
                    We have recently begun to offer thin bagels, as well as expanding our menu to include a variety of bagel sandwiches to offer
                    something to fill you up throughout the day (not just at breakfast).  See our menu for our selection of bagel sandwiches.
                </p>
                <h3>Delivery</h3>
                <p>
                    In response to several suggestions by our customers, many of whom found themselves stuck in the office and wanting a snack, we
                    have begun to offer office delivery for all of our customers who cannot come to us during work.
                </p>
