                <h3>About The Lox</h3>
                <p>The Lox started 10 years ago when two brothers, Chaviv and Chaim, were temporarily out-of-work and looking for a new job.  Chaim had been a
                cook for a short time, and Chaviv had a love of coffee.  Driving through the city they saw all manner of eateries, but none that
                catered to their own love of bagels and lox.  Chaim jokingly suggested they start their own bagel shop, and out of that came The Lox.</p>
                <p>For ten years now the brothers have honed their skills at preparing fresh bagels and serving them up with all your favorite
                culinary embellishments.  The Lox has grown to have a regular crowd of customers, and in response to their suggestions, has expanded to offer
                bagel sandwiches.  Also added recently was an office delivery service for those stuck in their cubicles but wanting their favorite foods from
                The Lox.</p>
                <p>(The Lox is also pleased to note, for those customers who have any concerns, that our establishment meets the standards for the laws of
                <i>kashrut</i>, and we are happy to provide those credentials for inspection upon request.)</p>
                <p>The Lox is happy to be here, and hopes to continue serving your bagel and coffee needs for years to come.</p>
